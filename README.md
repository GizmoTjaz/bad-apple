<h1 align="center">Bad Apple</h1>
Plays Bad Apple inside your terminal, because why not? This time it is not pre-rendered like most other versions.
<br></br>

# Prerequisites
You must have FFmpeg installed and have it set in your path.

# Getting Started

Make sure to **globally** install the module
```
npm i -g bad-apple
```

After it is installed, you can play it with one simple command from anywhere:
```
bad-apple
```
If this is your first time running the command, you will be prompted to download the video first.
